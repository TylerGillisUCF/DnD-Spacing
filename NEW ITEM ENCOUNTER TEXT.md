## 2. FRIEND'S FAVOR (4 Coins)

### For Beggar Encounter:

```
**OPTION 2B: PURCHASE FRIEND'S FAVOR TOKEN (4 Coins)**

[The Beggar reaches into their tattered cloak]

"Ah, you wish to help others on their journey? How noble! I have something special for heroes with generous hearts."

[Pulls out a small bronze medallion stamped with two hands clasped together]

"This is a Friend's Favor token. When one of your companions fails and faces hardship, you can use this to take their burden upon yourself - their failure becomes YOUR failure instead. And you know what? The universe rewards such selfless acts. You'll gain a coin for your sacrifice, and fortune will smile upon you - your next roll will have advantage!"

[Looks at you meaningfully]

"True heroes don't just seek power for themselves. They protect their friends. This token embodies that spirit. 4 coins."

**EFFECT:** Save another player from one failed roll by taking the failure yourself
**REWARD:** You gain +1 coin AND advantage on your next roll (heroic sacrifice!)
**USAGE:** When another player fails a non-combat roll, declare you're using this. You take their failure/consequences, they succeed instead.

## 3. SECOND CHANCE CHARM (7 Coins)

### For Potion Seller - Tier 2:

```
**TIER 2 - SECOND CHANCE CHARM (7 Coins)**

[The Potion Seller produces an elegant silver bracelet with a small hourglass charm]

"Ah! The Second Chance Charm! This is VERY popular. You know those moments where you ALMOST succeed? Rolled an 8 when you needed a 9? A 12 when you needed a 13? Those heartbreaking near-misses? This charm turns those into victories!"

[Demonstrates with the charm]

"If you fail a roll by 3 or less - just barely miss the mark - the charm activates automatically and turns that failure into a success! Almost counts with this beauty! One-time use, but it could save you at a crucial moment!"

**EFFECT:** If you fail a roll by 3 or less, it becomes a success instead
**USAGE:** Automatically activates on your next "close call" failure
**SIMPLE RULE:** "Almost counts!" - Turns near-misses into wins.

[Player pays 7 coins]

**[DM announces:]**
**OUTCOME:**
**Coins:** -7 (now have ~X coins)
**Second Chance Charm gained:** Mark on character sheet
**Close Call Protection:** The next time you fail a roll by 1, 2, or 3 points (roll + modifiers is 1-3 below the DC), the charm activates and you succeed instead! Charm is then used up.

**EXAMPLE:** If DC is 12 and you roll total of 9, 10, or 11, the charm makes you succeed! If you roll 8 or below, charm doesn't help (missed by too much).

[Update character sheet: -7 coins, add "Second Chance Charm (1-time use)"]
```

## 4. KARMA REVERSAL TOKEN (8 Coins)

### For Fortune Teller - Tier 2:

```
**TIER 2 - KARMA REVERSAL TOKEN (8 Coins)**

[The Fortune Teller's expression becomes mysterious]

"Ah, but for those willing to pay more, I offer something... extraordinary. The Karma Reversal Token."

[Produces a coin that seems to shimmer between black and white]

"Fate is not always kind. Sometimes you roll a Natural 1 - disaster, catastrophe, humiliation! But THIS token? It reverses your karma at that very moment. That Natural 1 becomes a Natural 20! Instant disaster becomes instant triumph! The cosmic joke becomes YOUR victory!"

[The coin flips in the air, showing both faces]

"It only works once - when you roll that dreaded 1, you declare you're using the token, and suddenly the die shows 20 instead! Bad luck becomes AMAZING luck! Eight coins for the power to turn fate itself upside down!"

**EFFECT:** Turn your next Natural 1 into a Natural 20
**USAGE:** Must declare immediately after rolling a Natural 1 (before DM describes the result)
**SIMPLE RULE:** "Bad luck becomes AMAZING luck!" - Disaster becomes triumph.

[Player pays 8 coins]

**[DM announces:]**
**OUTCOME:**
**Coins:** -8 (now have ~X coins)
**Karma Reversal Token gained:** Mark on character sheet
**Fate Reversal:** The next time you roll a Natural 1, you can immediately declare you're using this token. The Natural 1 becomes a Natural 20 instead! You get critical success instead of critical failure, earn the bonus coin from the Nat 20, and avoid all Nat 1 penalties. Token is then used up.

[Update character sheet: -8 coins, add "Karma Reversal Token (1-time use)"]
```

## 5. SHARED BLESSING (10 Coins)

### For Beggar Encounter - Generous Donation:

```
**OPTION 3: GENEROUS DONATION - SHARED BLESSING (10 Coins)**

[The Beggar's eyes widen as you offer such a generous sum]

"Ten coins? Such... such generosity! I have not seen kindness like this in years!"

[The Beggar stands straighter, and for a moment seems less frail]

"For such a gift, I must give you something equally precious. Not just a blessing for you alone, but the power to bless ANOTHER!"

[Reaches into their cloak and produces a radiant golden medallion]

"This is a Shared Blessing. You give this to one of your companions - someone you believe in, someone you trust. When they face a crucial challenge, they can use this blessing to roll twice and take the better result! And when they succeed using your gift? A coin returns to you as the universe's thanks for your faith in them!"

[Places the medallion in your hands]

"You gave to someone who had nothing. Now you can give to someone who needs advantage. The circle of generosity continues!"

**EFFECT:** Give another player advantage on any single roll
**REWARD for Giver:** Earn +1 coin when they use it successfully
**USAGE:** Give to ally, they decide when to use it. They roll twice and take the better result.
**SIMPLE RULE:** "I believe in you!" - Teamwork creates success.

[Update character sheet: -10 coins, add "Shared Blessing (give to ally)"]
```

## 6. HERO'S DETERMINATION (15 Coins)

### For Potion Seller - Tier 4:

```
**TIER 4 - HERO'S DETERMINATION (15 Coins)**

[The Potion Seller's voice drops to a reverent whisper]

"And now... for my most precious item. Hero's Determination. Fifteen coins."

[Carefully produces a brilliant crystal that pulses with inner light]

"This is not just a potion or a charm. This is concentrated WILL. The refusal to fail. The power of absolute determination! When you face a challenge that you absolutely, positively CANNOT fail - you use this!"

[The crystal glows brighter]

"Declare before you roll: 'I will NOT fail this!' You don't even need to roll. You just... succeed. Automatically. No chance of failure. No dice gods to appease. Pure, guaranteed success!"

[Sets it carefully on the counter]

"It works exactly once. And it costs fifteen coins - everything you've earned so far. But imagine: the critical moment. The impossible challenge. The roll that determines everything. And you CANNOT fail. Worth it? Only you can decide!"

**EFFECT:** Automatically succeed on any single roll of your choice
**USAGE:** Declare before rolling. Guarantees success, no roll needed.
**SIMPLE RULE:** "I will NOT fail this!" - Ultimate power when it matters most.

[Player pays 15 coins - this is EXPENSIVE!]

**[DM announces:]**
**OUTCOME:**
**Coins:** -15 (now have ~X coins remaining - this is a MAJOR purchase!)
**Hero's Determination gained:** Mark on character sheet
**Guaranteed Success:** When facing any single challenge (except combat exchanges in a best-of series), you can declare BEFORE rolling: "I'm using Hero's Determination!" You automatically succeed. No roll needed. Perfect success. The challenge is passed. Crystal is then used up.

**LIMITATIONS:**
- Cannot be used on individual exchanges in best-of-3/5 combat (too granular)
- CAN be used to auto-succeed an entire Challenge, an encounter objective, or a critical roll
- Once used, it's gone forever

**STRATEGIC USE:** Save for the moment that absolutely CANNOT fail. Final boss challenge? Crucial persuasion? Life-or-death decision? THIS is your ace in the hole!

[Update character sheet: -15 coins, add "Hero's Determination (1-time auto-win)"]
